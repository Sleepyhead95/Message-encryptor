# Message Encryptor/Decryptor

This JavaScript project was a part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course that I am currently taking. Here, I was tasked to write a class with two functions: encrypt and decrypt. These functions take a plain text message and shift each letter forward (or backward) in the alphabet by a given number. For example, a shift cipher with a shift of 1 would turn the string 'hello' to 'ifmmp'. I accounted for all characters, not just the alphabet.
